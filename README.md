# Deterministic Coding

**Open Interface Engineering, Inc. (openIE)**

Research into deterministic code generation and auditing — replacing probabilistic AI inference with mathematically grounded verification and bounded-entropy generation.

## Whitepapers

### 1. Bounded Entropy in Formal Languages
*A Mathematical Foundation for Deterministic Code Generation*

Demonstrates that programming languages, as formally bounded systems, exhibit predictable entropy that enables deterministic code generation without reliance on LLMs for the majority of tasks. Introduces Constraint Stacking and a six-layer lookup-first architecture achieving 96%+ resolution through deterministic retrieval.

### 2. Deterministic Code Auditing for Production-Ready Software
*A Polyglot Static Analysis System with Fruition Scoring*

Presents AI-Verify, a deterministic code auditing system using tree-sitter parsing across 15 programming languages. Introduces the Fruition Score for quantifying code completeness. 94.7% precision in detecting incomplete code, <100ms per file.

### 3. Cortex: Neural-Symbolic Programming for Energy-Efficient Code Execution
*A Unified Language for Polyglot Code Lifting with Continuous Program State Representation*

Presents Cortex, a neural-symbolic programming language that unifies code from 21 languages into a single intermediate representation, tracks program state via Mamba-style State Space Models, and executes with multi-backend optimization. Achieves 35-100x energy savings versus generative approaches.
